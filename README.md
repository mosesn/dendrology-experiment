## Dendrology Experiments
This currently has four exercises from Brandon Bloom's talk on [Dendrology][0],
one pretty-printing trees, doing an in-order numbering of the tree, doing a
breadth first traversal of the tree, and a breadth-first number of the tree.

## Experimenting with clojure
I've read the joy of clojure, but I wasn't interested enough to ever actually
touch it, so this is my first real foray.  For this reason, the code is quite
ugly, and not at all idiomatic.  
  
I'd love some advice on how to make my code more idiomatic.

## Next Steps

### generate a tree diagram
svg or pic might be useful  
 
probably won't happen
