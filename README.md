## Dendrology Experiments
This currently has two exercises from Brandon Bloom's talk on [Dendrology][0],
one pretty-printing trees, and the other doing an in-order numbering of the tree

## Experimenting with clojure
I've read the joy of clojure, but I wasn't interested enough to ever actually
touch it, so this is my first real foray.  For this reason, the code is quite
ugly, and not at all idiomatic.

## Next Steps

### generate a tree diagram
svg or pic might be useful

probably won't happen
